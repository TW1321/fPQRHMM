# fPQRHMMal
This package `fPQRHMMal` performs dimension reduction for Quantile Regression by combining the `fPQR` algorithm developed by Civieta et al. 
in 2021, and the `HMM` algorithm developed by Bar et al. in 2021. It uses source codes from the `QREM` and `SEMMS` packages written by Haim Bar
and is partially based on the `fpqr` package written by Álvaro Méndez Civieta.

This package can be installed using
```{r}
devtools::install_github("TW1321/fPQRHMM")

This package can be loaded using "library"
